## About

<p> This repository provides access to comprehensive datasets capturing both the front and rear perspectives of vehicles in Bangladesh. Researchers, developers, and enthusiasts can utilize this resource for various applications, such as vehicle recognition, traffic analysis, and surveillance. The dataset encompasses a diverse range of vehicle types and is a valuable asset for projects related to computer vision, machine learning, and transportation systems in the context of Bangladesh. Additionally, this dataset supports the file system for the You Only Look Once (YOLO) family, enhancing its compatibility with YOLO-based algorithms for efficient and accurate object detection.

<b>In this dataset the 'Front' part of the vehicle considered as right way and the 'Rear' part of the vehicle considered as worng way.</b>

## YOLOv5 .txt format

<p>Each image has one txt file with a single line for each bounding box. The format of each row is:</p>

   ```sh
   class_id center_x center_y width height
   ```
Example: 

   ```sh
   0.223690 0.620533 0.209852 0.201429
   ```
